- Grid Types.
    - Add reference to spurious oscillations. 
    - Include copyright in Matthias Muller image or create my own one. 
    - Turn staggered grid sketch into black and white. 

- Algorithm. 
    - Create 2 algorithm sketchs. 
    - Explain the different terms in the Poisson equation. State their equations. 

- Poisson Solver. 
    - Poner los links de Colab chuckun. Make sure repositories are up to date and pull when finished. 
    - Embedd executable python scripts. Optional
    - Add more convergence graphs and plots. 

- Boundary Conditions. 
    - Continue work on the same line
    - This have became into a complete analysis of the different solutions. 
         Maybe I need to rename this into the Results section.. and add an animated solution featuring the velocity? 

- Results.
    - Recover results chapter, embedding animated solutions for the different problem cases. 

Conclusion
    - Writte up a Conclusion. Necessary? 

- Github. 
    - CleanUp codes. 
    - Build clear documentation. 


What Peter wants: 
- Focus on mkdocs, try to show cool things, like..
    - Embedd animation. Do this forsure. 
    - Present equations numbered (latex style). Do this for sure. 
    - Embedd scripts. optional
    - Brainstorm about other cool things I could do with mkdocs.
