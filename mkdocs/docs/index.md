# A Journey into Solving the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations
or
# An Educational Framework for Incompressible Navier-Stokes Solvers fdjskahjkfdshjka

This project presents an educational documentation of a **numerical solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations**, developed as part of an independent study during my final semester at the University of Colorado Boulder. The goal is to synthesize key concepts and methods used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and to make the solver code and methodology accessible to students and early researchers. I hope this resource serves as a foundation for others to build their understanding of CFD and help them develop their own solvers.

I would like to thank **Prof. Peter Hamlington** for his guidance and mentorship throughout this project, and **Dr. Colin Towery** for his technical support and feedback.

If you have any questions or feedback about the material, please feel free to reach out.
