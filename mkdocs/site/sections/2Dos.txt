X Grid Types: Update schematic of staggered grid (Ipad). 
    - Remove Matthias Muller figure, dont replace, just set my own drawing for the collocated type.  
X BC's: Add comparison of 2 solutions. 
- Poisson Solver: Update Colab links. 
- Algorithm: Update schematics. 
- References: Review references, set numbers, review links. 
- Conclusion: Writte a conclusion (Or skip this?).
- Final review. 
X Merge with Colin. 
X Grid Types: Include mesh refinement figure into Poisson chapter. 
- Algorithm: Include Algorithm 2 predictor corrector schematic
- Solutions: Include pressure around rotor plots and comparison in the axial induction part. 
- Solutions: Include Peter's requested animation. 
- Grid Types: Add a plot of simulation time vs grid refinement. 

Before Group presentation 
X Abstract, titles. 
- Number references. 
- Add figures to the discretization chapter.
-> Correct black background figures.
